## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

First time using grid without libraries (ex. bootstrap). I had no idea grid has so many options. Really enjoyed this challenge.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Grid layout guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This helped me a lot with building grid layout.
